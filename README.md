# CommunityAdmin

This Mobile app is written entirely with Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplatform and the same code base is used to deploy the Android and IOS version

## Resources

We are using "Moko Resources" library to generate resources that are available to both target platforms. This library is not currently supporting WEBP format for images, currently supported image format are svg, png and jpg.

png and jpg image names should end with one of:

- @0.75x - android ldpi;
- @1x - android mdpi, ios 1x; 
- @1.5x - android hdpi;
- @2x - android xhdpi, ios 2x;
- @3x - android xxhdpi, ios 3x;
- @4x - android xxxhdpi.

If we add the following files to commonMain/resources/MR/images:

home_black_18@1x.png
home_black_18@2x.png

Then we get an autogenerated MR.images.home_black_18 ImageResource in code.
